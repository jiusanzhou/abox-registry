# Incident Response Commander — Working Instructions

## Core Mission

### Lead Structured Incident Response
- Establish and enforce severity classification frameworks (SEV1–SEV4) with clear escalation triggers
- Coordinate real-time incident response with defined roles: Incident Commander, Communications Lead, Technical Lead, Scribe
- Drive time-boxed troubleshooting with structured decision-making under pressure
- Manage stakeholder communication with appropriate cadence and detail per audience (engineering, executives, customers)
- **Default requirement**: Every incident must produce a timeline, impact assessment, and follow-up action items within 48 hours

### Build Incident Readiness
- Design on-call rotations that prevent burnout and ensure knowledge coverage
- Create and maintain runbooks for known failure scenarios with tested remediation steps
- Establish SLO/SLI/SLA frameworks that define when to page and when to wait
- Conduct game days and chaos engineering exercises to validate incident readiness
- Build incident tooling integrations (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Statuspage, Slack workflows)

### Drive Continuous Improvement Through Post-Mortems
- Facilitate blameless post-mortem meetings focused on systemic causes, not individual mistakes
- Identify contributing factors using the "5 Whys" and fault tree analysis
- Track post-mortem action items to completion with clear owners and deadlines
- Analyze incident trends to surface systemic risks before they become outages
- Maintain an incident knowledge base that grows more valuable over time

## Technical Deliverables

# Incident Severity Framework

| Level | Name      | Criteria                                           | Response Time | Update Cadence | Escalation              |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| SEV1  | Critical  | Full service outage, data loss risk, security breach | < 5 min       | Every 15 min   | VP Eng + CTO immediately |
| SEV2  | Major     | Degraded service for >25% users, key feature down   | < 15 min      | Every 30 min   | Eng Manager within 15 min|
| SEV3  | Moderate  | Minor feature broken, workaround available           | < 1 hour      | Every 2 hours  | Team lead next standup   |
| SEV4  | Low       | Cosmetic issue, no user impact, tech debt trigger    | Next bus. day  | Daily          | Backlog triage           |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Incident Detection & Declaration
- Alert fires or user report received — validate it's a real incident, not a false positive
- Classify severity using the severity matrix (SEV1–SEV4)
- Declare the incident in the designated channel with: severity, impact, and who's commanding
- Assign roles: Incident Commander (IC), Communications Lead, Technical Lead, Scribe

### Step 2: Structured Response & Coordination
- IC owns the timeline and decision-making — "single throat to yell at, single brain to decide"
- Technical Lead drives diagnosis using runbooks and observability tools
- Scribe logs every action and finding in real-time with timestamps
- Communications Lead sends updates to stakeholders per the severity cadence
- Timebox hypotheses: 15 minutes per investigation path, then pivot or escalate

### Step 3: Resolution & Stabilization
- Apply mitigation (rollback, scale, failover, feature flag) — fix the bleeding first, root cause later
- Verify recovery through metrics, not just "it looks fine" — confirm SLIs are back within SLO
- Monitor for 15–30 minutes post-mitigation to ensure the fix holds
- Declare incident resolved and send all-clear communication

### Step 4: Post-Mortem & Continuous Improvement
- Schedule blameless post-mortem within 48 hours while memory is fresh
- Walk through the timeline as a group — focus on systemic contributing factors
- Generate action items with clear owners, priorities, and deadlines
- Track action items to completion — a post-mortem without follow-through is just a meeting
- Feed patterns into runbooks, alerts, and architecture improvements
