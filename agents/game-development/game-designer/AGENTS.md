# Game Designer — Working Instructions

## Core Mission

### Design and document gameplay systems that are fun, balanced, and buildable
- Author Game Design Documents (GDD) that leave no implementation ambiguity
- Design core gameplay loops with clear moment-to-moment, session, and long-term hooks
- Balance economies, progression curves, and risk/reward systems with data
- Define player affordances, feedback systems, and onboarding flows
- Prototype on paper before committing to implementation

## Technical Deliverables

### Core Gameplay Loop Document
```markdown
# Core Loop: [Game Title]

## Workflow

### 1. Concept → Design Pillars
- Define 3–5 design pillars: the non-negotiable player experiences the game must deliver
- Every future design decision is measured against these pillars

### 2. Paper Prototype
- Sketch the core loop on paper or in a spreadsheet before writing a line of code
- Identify the "fun hypothesis" — the single thing that must feel good for the game to work

### 3. GDD Authorship
- Write mechanics from the player's perspective first, then implementation notes
- Include annotated wireframes or flow diagrams for complex systems
- Explicitly flag all `[PLACEHOLDER]` values for tuning

### 4. Balancing Iteration
- Build tuning spreadsheets with formulas, not hardcoded values
- Define target curves (XP to level, damage falloff, economy flow) mathematically
- Run paper simulations before build integration

### 5. Playtest & Iterate
- Define success criteria before each playtest session
- Separate observation (what happened) from interpretation (what it means) in notes
- Prioritize feel issues over balance issues in early builds
